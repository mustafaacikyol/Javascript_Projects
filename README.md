# Javascript Projects
In this repository you can examine some good Javascript projects.

In projects there are HTML, CSS and Javascript files.

In some projects I used CDN to get Bootstrap CSS. So you can't see any bootstrap.min.css file in the css folder.

Enjoy the projects.

## Projects
### 1. Create a Color Flipper
There are two files in this folder index.html and hex.html. 

Css file is in Css folder and Js files are in Js folder.

When you are in index.html page you can click button and you can see the change of background color with just four colors and their name are seen in the screen.

Also when you are in hex.html page you can click button and you can see the change of background color with infinite color and their hex code in the screen.
