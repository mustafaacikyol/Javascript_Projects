# Javascript Projects
In this repository you can examine some good Javascript projects.

I used website of https://www.freecodecamp.org to build these projects.

In projects there are HTML, CSS and Javascript files.

In some projects I used CDN to get Bootstrap CSS. So you can't see any bootstrap.min.css file in the css folder.

Enjoy the projects.

## Projects
### 1. Create a Color Flipper
There are two files in this folder index.html and hex.html. 

Css file is in Css folder and Js files are in Js folder.

When you are in index.html page you can click button and you can see the change of background color with just four colors and their names are seen in the screen.

Also when you are in hex.html page you can click button and you can see the change of background color with infinite color and their hex code in the screen.

### 2. Counter
There is a counter in this project. You can see decreasement, reset, increasement buttons and a counter.

If the counter shows positive number then its color will be green and if the counter shows negative number then its color will be red.

If you click reset button then its color black and it shows zero.
