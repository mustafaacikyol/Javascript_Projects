# Javascript Projects
In this repository you can examine some good Javascript projects.

I used website of https://www.freecodecamp.org to build these projects.

In projects there are HTML, CSS and Javascript files and some images.

In some projects I used CDN to get Bootstrap CSS. So you can't see any bootstrap.min.css file in the css folder.

Enjoy the projects.

## Projects
### 1. Color Flipper
When you are in index.html page you can click button and you can see the change of background color with just four colors and their names are seen in the screen.

Also when you are in hex.html page you can click button and you can see the change of background color with infinite color and their hex code in the screen.

### 3. Review Carousel
In this project you will see a review carousel and random button. 

When you click "Surprise Me" button then it shows randomly informations and images.

### 4. Responsive Navbar
One breakpoint is used in this responsive project and it is 992 px.

On devices with a screen width of 991px and lower, you will see a hamburger menu and when you click on this menu, you will see the links that drop down.

On devices with a screen width greater than 991 px, you will be able to see the links wit the brand logo in one line.

### 5. Sidebar
There are two breakpoints(768px and 992px) in this project.

On screens smaller than 768px, you will see a sidebar that fills the entire screen.

In the range of 768px and 992px screen width, you will see a sidebar that takes up half of the screen.

On screens larger than 992px, you will see a sidebar that takes up 40% of the screen.

In this project, when the hamburger menu button is clicked, we add the 'show-sidebar' class for the sidebar, if it does not contain it, we remove it if it does.

When the cross button is clicked on the sidebar menu that opens, we remove the 'show-sidebar' class for the sidebar.

### 6. Modal
In this project, when you click the open modal button, a modal is opened to cover the entire screen you are on.

You can close the modal by clicking the cross icon.

In this project, the class named 'show-modal' is added or removed and the modal is opened and closed via buttons.

### 7. Frequently Asked Questions
In this section, when you click on the question, the answer is opened and at the same time, if there is a question with an open answer, its answer is also closed.

The answer to the question is opened and closed by toogle with the 'show-text' class.

With the forEach loop, when another question is clicked, the answer to the open question is closed.

### 8. Menu
There is a restaurant menu in this project.

All dishes are displayed on the page when the page is loaded.

When the button of the dishes divided into types is clicked, those dishes are listed.

The buttons update themselves dynamically when a new food type is added.

Map, reduce, filter and join are used in this project.

### 9. Video Background
In this project, there is a preloader that is displayed on the screen until the page is loaded, and a video in the background of the page after the page is loaded.

You can pause and play the video in the background with the button in the lower left corner of the page.

### 10. Navigation Bar on Scroll
The date in the footer section updates itself dynamically with the javascript code.

When a new link is added or deleted in the navigation menu, the height of the menu dynamically adjusts itself.

When scrolling more than the height of the navigation menu, the navigation menu changes to the fixed position and the go to top button appears.

The default settings of the links in the navigation menu are blocked by javascript code, and when the link is clicked, it is written with javascript code to go to the relevant section. The reason why this is done is because the navigation menu is fixed after a certain scroll and the navigation menu with a screen width less than 800px is a hamburger menu, so the links are opened downwards, and therefore the height of the navigation bar is variable.

### 11. Tabs
There are 3 tab buttons in this project.

When the buttons are clicked, it displays its own content on the screen.

### 12. Countdown Clock
Countdown clock is included in this project.

When the time expires, the time expired message appears on the screen.

### 13. Lorem Ipsum
There is one form in this project.

When you enter a number in the input and click the button, the number of paragraphs you enter is created and displayed on the screen.

If you enter a number less than zero or greater than nine, only one paragraph is shown.

### 14. Grocery Bud
With this project, you can create your grocery shopping list.

You can delete and edit items from the grocery list you created.

You can delete items one by one, or you can delete them all at once.

Localstorage is also used in this project.

The shopping list you create is stored in localstorage and your data comes from localstorage whenever you visit the application.

### 15. Carousel Slider
Carousel slider is included in this project.

When the active codes are run, the slider works as a carousel.

If you do not want the slider to work as a carousel, follow the steps I have specified in the comment lines inside the javascript file.
