# Javascript Projects
In this repository you can examine some good Javascript projects.

I used website of https://www.freecodecamp.org to build these projects.

In projects there are HTML, CSS and Javascript files.

In some projects I used CDN to get Bootstrap CSS. So you can't see any bootstrap.min.css file in the css folder.

Enjoy the projects.

There are two breakpoints(768px and 992px) in this project.

On screens smaller than 768px, you will see a sidebar that fills the entire screen.

In the range of 768px and 992px screen width, you will see a sidebar that takes up half of the screen.

On screens larger than 992px, you will see a sidebar that takes up 40% of the screen.

In this project, when the hamburger menu button is clicked, we add the 'show-sidebar' class for the sidebar, if it does not contain it, we remove it if it does.

When the cross button is clicked on the sidebar menu that opens, we remove the 'show-sidebar' class for the sidebar.

In this project, when you click the open modal button, a modal is opened to cover the entire screen you are on.

You can close the modal by clicking the cross icon.

In this project, the class named 'show-modal' is added or removed and the modal is opened and closed via buttons.

### 7. Frequently Asked Questions
In this section, when you click on the question, the answer is opened and at the same time, if there is a question with an open answer, its answer is also closed.

The answer to the question is opened and closed by toogle with the 'show-text' class.

With the forEach loop, when another question is clicked, the answer to the open question is closed.
